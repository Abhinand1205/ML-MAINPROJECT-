Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction - Project Summary
This project aims to predict airline passenger satisfaction using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information on passenger demographics, flight details, and service ratings. After thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and correcting skewness, we performed feature selection to identify the most important features.

We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including RandomForest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost. To optimize the RandomForest model, we performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and generalization.

The final tuned RandomForest model demonstrated strong performance, with high accuracy and balanced precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. We also analyzed feature importance, providing insights into which factors contribute the most to passenger satisfaction.

The project is complete with model saving for future use, making it ready for deployment in real-world applications to predict customer satisfaction efficiently.
